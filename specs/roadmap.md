3. **Testing**: Test each feature as built
4. **Commit**: Frequent commits with clear messages
5. **Evening**: Update progress, plan next day

### Code Organization
- Keep template structure intact where possible
- Add new features in separate modules
- Follow existing patterns for consistency
- Document new APIs and components

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services
- Integration tests for APIs
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Manual testing for UI/UX

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers & Solutions

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM API complexity | High | Start with OpenAI only |
| Code extraction accuracy | High | Build robust fallbacks |
| File storage scaling | Medium | Local first, S3 ready |
| Streaming implementation | Medium | Use SSE, not WebSockets |
| Migration conflicts | Low | Test thoroughly |

### Fallback Options
- **If LLM integration delayed**: Mock responses for UI development
- **If code parsing complex**: Start with simple regex patterns
- **If file uploads problematic**: Text paste as alternative
- **If streaming difficult**: Polling as temporary solution
